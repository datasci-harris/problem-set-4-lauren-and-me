**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
We use (`*`) to indicate a problem that we think might be time consuming. 
    
## Style Points (10 pts) 
Please refer to the minilesson on code style
**[here](https://uchicago.zoom.us/rec/share/pG_wQ-pHTQrJTmqNn4rcrw5V194M2H2s-2jdy8oVhWHkd_yZt9o162IWurpA-fxU.BIQlSgZLRYctvzp-)**.

## Submission Steps (10 pts)
1. This problem set is a paired problem set.
2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person *Partner 1*.
    - Partner 1 Lauren Laine, llaine:
    - Partner 2 (name and cnet ID):
3. Partner 1 will accept the `ps4` and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted. 
4. "This submission is our work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy." Add your initials to indicate your agreement: \*\*\_\_\*\* \*\*\_\_\*\*
5. "I have uploaded the names of anyone else other than my partner and I worked with on the problem set **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/185usrCREQaUbvAXpWhChkjghdGgmAZXA3lPWpXLLsts/edit)**"  (1 point)
6. Late coins used this pset: \*\*\_\_\*\* Late coins left after submission: \*\*\_\_\*\*
7. Knit your `ps4.qmd` to an PDF file to make `ps4.pdf`, 
    * The PDF should not be more than 25 pages. Use `head()` and re-size figures when appropriate. 
8. (Partner 1): push  `ps4.qmd` and `ps4.pdf` to your github repo.
9. (Partner 1): submit `ps4.pdf` via Gradescope. Add your partner on Gradescope.
10. (Partner 1): tag your submission in Gradescope

**Important:** Repositories are for tracking code. **Do not commit the data or shapefiles to your repo.** The best way to do this is with `.gitignore`, which we have covered in class. If you do accidentally commit the data, Github has a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history). The best course of action depends on whether you have pushed yet. This also means that both partners will have to download the initial raw data and any data cleaning code will need to be re-run on both partners' computers.

**Question 1.2**
```{python}
pos2016=pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\laine\OneDrive\Documents\Harris\Fall 2024\Python II\pos2016.csv')
```

```{python}
short_term_hos_2016=pos2016[pos2016['PRVDR_CTGRY_CD']==1]
short_term_hos_2016=short_term_hos_2016[short_term_hos_2016['PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD']==1]
short_term_hos_2016['year']=2016
print(len(short_term_hos_2016))
```
There are 7245 hospitals reported in this data. This seems very low. The Kaiser Family Foundation article reports that "here are nearly 5,000 short-term, acute care hospitals in the United States". That estimate may be smaller because they are filtering down even further to acute care hospitals. 

Definitive Healthcare reports 3,873 short term acute care hospitals as of April 2024. That estimate is much lower than the estimate from the 2016 data. There may have been many hospital closures since 2016 but it seems unlikely that the number of short term hospitals would decrease by almost 50%.

short_term_hos_2018['year']=2018
print(len(short_term_hos_2018))

```{python}
# import and subset pos2018

short_term_hos_2019=pos2019[pos2019['PRVDR_CTGRY_CD']==1]
short_term_hos_2019=short_term_hos_2019[short_term_hos_2019['PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD']==1]
short_term_hos_2019['year']=2019
print(len(short_term_hos_2019))
```

There are 7260 short term hospitals in the 2017 dataset. There are 7277 short term hospitals in the 2018 dataset. There are 7303 short term hospitals in the 2019 dataset. 


```{python}
full_df=pd.concat([short_term_hos_2016,short_term_hos_2017,short_term_hos_2018,short_term_hos_2019])
```

```{python}
alt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows()
plot_1_3=alt.Chart(full_df, title="Number of Short Term Hospitals by Year").mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('year:Q'),
    alt.Y('count(FAC_NAME):Q').scale(zero=False)
)
plot_1_3
```

**Question 1.4**

```{python}
plot_1_4=alt.Chart(full_df, title="Number of Short Term Unique Hospitals by Year").mark_bar().transform_aggregate(
    unique_num='count(FAC_NAME)',
    groupby=['PRVDR_NUM', 'year']
).encode(
    alt.X('year:Q'),
    alt.Y('unique_num:Q').scale(zero=False)
)
plot_1_4
```
The plot of unique hospitals looks very similar to the first plot. This suggests that there was already only 1 observation for most hospitals/ few if any hospitals had the same CMS certification number.
